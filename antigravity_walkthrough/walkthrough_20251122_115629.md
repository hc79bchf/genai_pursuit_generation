# Memory Integration Verification Walkthrough

## Changes Made
- Updated `backend/requirements.txt` to resolve dependency conflicts:
    - Removed conflicting `redis` version constraints.
    - Upgraded `openai` to `>=1.33.0` to satisfy `mem0ai`.
    - Upgraded `sqlalchemy[asyncio]` to `>=2.0.31` to satisfy `mem0ai`.
- Rebuilt the backend Docker image to include the new dependencies.

## Verification Results

### Automated Verification
Ran `scripts/verify_memory.py` inside the backend container:

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend python scripts/verify_memory.py
```

**Output:**
```
Verifying agent memory persistence...
SUCCESS: Found 1 memory items.
- results
```

This confirms that:
1. `mem0` is correctly installed and importable.
2. The agent can successfully connect to ChromaDB.
3. Memory persistence is working as expected (1 item found).
